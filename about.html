    <p>Hello world is a site that allows me to learn and understand how GitHub works.</p>
    <p>One day I will laugh, when I think back to why I needed to do this!</p>

    "Git add" tells Git to track the files. Once Git knows about them then it can track them when you checkout other branches. If you don't add them then they will appear in every branch. This is important to remember and allows you to work on different branches and chnages at the same time.</p>
    <p>Creating a feature branch, making changes, merging develop in to the feature and then pushing to the remote repository is a cyclical process. 'Local Develop' should always be updated by 'Git pull'ing from the remote repository. Feature branches should be short lived and be merged back in to Develop and closed frequently. Long lived feature branches can cause problems if other developers are also pushing changes.</p>
